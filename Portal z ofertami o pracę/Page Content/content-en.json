The suction power adjusts to the surface it is currently working on. I needed a vacuum cleaner for an allergy sufferer, so there wasn't much choice. The vacuum is super quiet, you can talk while it's working. At minimal suction power, it's almost silent. Too bad the manufacturer didn't include storage for the attachments."

I also have an older version with a 650W motor and 58db, but... the older model, although more powerful, was louder and had weaker suction, and on top of that, the wheels were a mix of plastic and rubber, so it was harder to move and made more noise.
